# Three.js Streamline Plot

WIP project for a streamline plotter that runs entirely in the browser and will be compatible with the WebGL/WebXR standards through Three.js, and possibly use WebGPU for compute shaders as well.

TODO
- [x] deploy to GitHub Pages
- [ ] add streamlines to the particle system
- [ ] fix WebXR compatibility
